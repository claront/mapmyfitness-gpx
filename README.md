Build a web app that will convert mapmyfitness workouts to gpx format. Just html now, but might be ruby, golang, python or whatever backend. 
As just html, it looks okay in the browser with opening the index.html as a file open in a browser.
It also, looks fine going to the terminal, cd to the directory where the index.html exists and run ‘python -m SimpleHTTPServer’

Some inspiration and html borrowed from http://www.mikepalumbo.com/MMRConverter/index.php
